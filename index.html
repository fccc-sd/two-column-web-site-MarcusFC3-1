            <h3>About Me</h3>

            I, Marcus Jones Jr., was born in Central Michigan
            on <strong>February 4th of 2007.</strong> I lived in Michigan
            for the majority of my life until my family moved down
            to Northwest Ohio to live closer to my grandparents. I have lived in Defiance Ohio for over 5 years now,
            attending Tinora Middle School and High School. My junior year, I transferred to Four County Career Center
            to
            pursue my interest in computer programming and get a headstart on college.

            <h3>Goals</h3>

            <div id="goallist">


                <ul>
                    <li>Attain a degree in computer programming</li>
                    <li>Get a job that involves programming</li>
                    <li>Purchase my own home/property</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            I plan to attain an associate's degree in computer programming from
            <span id="nscc"><a href="https://northweststate.edu/"> Northwest State Community College</a></span>
            after graduating from Four County. Jobs in information and technology have a high salary average and so far
            I really
            enjoy everything about programming that I have learned at Four County so I would be quite excited to get any
            job that uses my degree.
            I would like to own a house because I have never lived on non-rented
            property and I think it would be nice to have a place
            to stay that is truly my own.

        <h3>Why I Chose Fitness</h3>

        While I can say that while fitness has postively 
            impacted almost every part of my life, It was very difficult to start.
             I've found that fitness gives me plenty of intangable benefits upon consistent performance like higher levels of confidence and just
            feeling satisfied with myself overall. I also found that fitness can be made into something enjoyable 
            instead of monotonously performing exercises and seeing the challenge as a downside, measuring my progress and
            striving to break my own records gives my workouts a sense of purpose that motivates me.

            <h3>Sports</h3>

            My top 3 sports are basketball, baseball, and football.
            Because I'm from Michigan, I'm always rooting for Detroit in every sport. 
            Currently I am excited to watch the Detroit lions during the 2023-2024 NFL season because they may 
            actually have a shot at a deep playoff run this year. I don't watch too much baseball because it isn't 
            as fun to watch as other sports but going to baseball games in person and playing baseball are both really fun. 
            Basketball might be my favorite sport of the three because I have played and watched it for the longest. 
            While I always want detroit to win whenever I'm watching, I don't really follow a single team when watching basketball.
             The only sport I have ever offically particpated in was 
            track and field at Tinora High School as a long distance runner and while I did enjoy my time on the team, I prefer to run alone.

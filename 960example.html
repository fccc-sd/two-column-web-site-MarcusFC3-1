                                        Video Games have been a huge part of my life since early childhood and I think they have had a large
                                        influence on my personality.
                                        I enjoy almost every kind of game from platformers to shooters to rpgs.
                                        Video games capture my attention through competition and/or fantasy. I find it really
                                        enjoyable to experiment with unorthodox strategies and climb my way up leaderboards in competitive games or
                                        take part in a fictional story when playing something more laid back.

                                        I would like to make my own indie game at some point in my life.
                                        I want to create either a 3d parkour game that contains a momentum based movement system and strategic melee
			                combat or a 2d pixel art platformer.

                                        Music is something that grew on me the more I was exposed to it and the older I got.270
                                        I think music can be used to express yourself in a way that isn't possible in other forms of media. If I were to develope an indie game, 
                                        I would also try to compose the music for it. I would aim to create a soundtrack that contains a lot of atmosphere and can be worth listening to on its own merits. 
                                        This soundtrack would likely be inspired by the original sound tracks for  Risk of Rain 2 and Persona 5 because I think they both excel at these two things.

                                        Because my class at Four County Career Center is about programming, me and my classmates
                                        are occasionally tasked with developing video games to demonstrate what we have learned. You can play the 2d games I have developed on 
                                        <a href="https://www.greenfoot.org/door">Greenfoot</a> using <a href="https://www.greenfoot.org/users/66373">this link.</a> 
                                        Currently I have created both a modified version of pong and a 2d platformer. 
                                        Our upcoming projects will be built in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. You can click <a href="unitygames.html">here</a> 
                                        to play one of Unity's prebuilt microgames that I will soon begin to modify.

        <h3>Interest</h3>

        I find fitness to be a really fun way to pass the time because it allows me to put my energy into something
        useful and improve my health. I have been playing videogames since I was a kid and they
        are really cool to me for many different reasons. I enjoy almost every kind of game from platformers to
        shooters to rpgs. Videogames capture my attention through competition and/or fantasy. I find it really
        enjoyable to climb my way up leaderboards in competitive games or take part in a fictional story when playing something more laid back.
         I enjoy many different music genres and I think that it is really effective way of expressing
        yourself.

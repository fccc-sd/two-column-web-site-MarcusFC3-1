			<h3>Video Games</h3>

			Video Games have been a huge part of my life since early childhood and I think they have had a large
			influence on my personality.
			I enjoy almost every kind of game from platformers to shooters to rpgs.
			Video games capture my attention through competition and/or fantasy. I find it really
			enjoyable to experiment with unorthodox strategies and climb my way up leaderboards in competitive games or
			take part in a fictional story when playing something more laid back.
			I would like to make my own indie game at some point in my life.
			I want to create either a 3d parkour game that contains a momentum based movement system and strategic melee
			combat or a 2d pixel art
			rougelike/platformer with a story mode.

			<h3>Music</h3>
			Music is something that grew on me the more I was exposed to it and the older I got. When I used to live in
			Michigan the only thing I would ever
			listen to was hip hop and while that still is my favorite genre,
			moving to Northwest Ohio exposed me to many other music genres that I also enjoy a lot.
			I think music can be used to express yourself in a way that isn't possible in other forms of media. If I were to develope an indie game, 
			I would also try to compose the music for it. I would aim to create a soundtrack that contains lots of atmosphere 
			that occasionly becomes upbeat and passionate. This soundtrack would likely be inspired by the original sound tracks for 
			Risk of Rain 2 and Persona 5 because I think they both excel at these two things.
